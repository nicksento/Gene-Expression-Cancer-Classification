# Gene Expression Cancer Classification

In this notebook we shall examine a gene expression dataset of patients having different types of tumor and attempt to classify these tumors into one of five classes: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD.

The collection of data is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq#).
